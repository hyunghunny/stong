IoT enabled Smart Food Wastebasket 


'stong' is a prototype wastebasket which is hacked at Maker's Weekend, Korea.

##'stong' was hacked with two different versions: 
 - stong-distance: a basket which has a distance sensor and a LED
 - stong-gas: a basket which has a thermo-hygrometer sensor and a methane gas sensor.
 

## Followings are the guide of sources:
  - arduino: contains the arduino sources to make it work the arduino sensors
  - nodejs: contains sources for the data visualization with stong-gas
