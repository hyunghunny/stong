# stong
IoT enabled Smart Food Wastebasket 


'stong' is a prototype wastebasket which is hacked at Maker's Weekend, Korea.

#'stong' was hacked with two versions: 
 - stong-distance: a basket which has a distance sensor and a LED
 - stong-gas: a basket which has a thermo-hygrometer sensor and a methane gas sensor.
 

# Followings are the sources:
  - arduino: contains the arduino sources to make it work the arduino sensors
  - nodejs: contains sources for the data visualization with stong-gas
